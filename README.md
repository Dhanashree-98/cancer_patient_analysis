## Project Structure 🛠️

 
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Handle missing values
  - Fix data types
  - Feature engineering (Age categories, BMI, Treatment delay days)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Distributions of numerical and categorical features
  - Identify skewness and outliers


- **Detailed Analysis And Visualization**
  - **Treatment Delay vs Outcome** (Violin, Swarm, ECDF plots)
  - **Cancer Stage vs Outcome** (Stacked bar)
  - **Mortality by Cancer Type** (Bar chart)
  - **Treatment Type vs Outcome** (Stacked bar with annotations)
  - **Age Vs Outcome & BMI Vs Outcome** (Boxplot)
